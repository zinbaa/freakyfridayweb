<h3>SYDNEY'S OPERA HOUSE</h3>
<div class="tekstattraksjoner">
	<p>
	The Sydney Opera House, located by the harbor, is regularly mentioned as one of the greatest architectural works of the 20th century, and is also listed on the World Heritage List. The Opera House has four major companies based there: Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, Sydney Theater Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Over one million people come here to see performances every year, while many more millions come to admire the building, which is a symphony in itself. <br>

<br>The Opera House is surrounded by Sydney Harbor on three sides, and the view from the monument's stairs is truly dramatic. Take a break on the stairs and photograph the harbor and harbor bridge in Sydney. Also, make sure that you get some good pictures of the opera house's famous "braid", which the white shells behind you make up.<br>

<br>Much of the inside of the opera house is freely accessible, so just look around. In the reception area you can see the beautiful floor-to-ceiling tapestries, which are inspired by Bach's Hamburg symphonies.
